Install command  - npm install -g @angular/cli
New Angular Project - ng new my-app

What is Angular CLI - To learn more about using the Angular CLI, see the CLI Overview. In addition to creating the initial workspace and app scaffolding, you can use the CLI to generate Angular code such as components and services. The CLI supports the full development cycle, including building, testing, bundling, and deployment.

Life Cycle Hooks - 

ngOnChanges() - Called before ngOnInit() and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change. Note that if your component has no inputs or you use it without providing any inputs, the framework will not call ngOnChanges().

ngOnInit()	
Initialize the directive or component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive or component's input properties. See details in Initializing a component or directive in this document.

ngDoCheck()	
Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own. 
Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.

ngAfterContentInit()	
Respond after Angular projects external content into the component's view, or into the view that a directive is in. Called once after the first ngDoCheck().

ngAfterContentChecked()	
Respond after Angular checks the content projected into the directive or component.Called after ngAfterContentInit() and every subsequent ngDoCheck().

ngAfterViewInit()	
Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views, or the view that contains the directive.
Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked().

ngAfterViewChecked()	
Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views, or the view that contains the directive.
Called after the ngAfterViewInit() and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked().

ngOnDestroy()	
Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive or component. Unsubscribe Observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks. See details in Cleaning up on instance destruction in this document.

Q. explains why you should avoid complex constructor logic.

View encapsulation
In Angular, component CSS styles are encapsulated into the component's view and don't affect the rest of the application.
you can set the view encapsulation mode in the component metadata. Choose from the following modes:
ViewEncapsulation.Native
ViewEncapsulation.Emulated
ViewEncapsulation.None


Parent Child Communication 

Parent to child -> @input
Child to Parent -> @output
Using a ref of child & calling in function
Using @viewchild
Using @viewChildern
Using a service with observable & stream

Preventing unauthorized access
Use route guards to prevent users from navigating to parts of an app without authorization. The following route guards are available in Angular:
CanActivate
CanActivateChild
CanDeactivate
Resolve
CanLoad


Q. LocationStrategy and browser URL styles ?


Choosing an approach
Reactive forms and template-driven forms process and manage form data differently. Each approach offers different advantages.

Reactive forms provide direct, explicit access to the underlying forms object model. Compared to template-driven forms, they are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.

Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template to create and manipulate the underlying object model. They are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. They're easy to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, template-driven forms could be a good fit.

Optimize angular app?

NGZone

In this video, We are going to cover the top 21+ Protractor Interview Questions and Answers with pdf download.

Question 1 : What is Protractor?
Answers : Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications.

Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.

Question 2 : Can Protractor be used for testing Non-Angular JS Applications?
Yes. Protractor can be used for testing Non-Angular JS or Non-Angular Apps.
browser.ignoreSynchronization = true;
browser.waitforangularenabled(false)


Question 3 : What are the test frameworks supported by Protractor?
Protractor supports two behavior driven development (BDD) test frameworks such as Jasmine & Mocha.


Question 4 : What is a conf file in Protractor?
The configuration file tells Protractor how to set up the Selenium Server, which tests to run, how to set up the browsers, and which test framework to use. 
The configuration file can also include one or more global settings. 
The config file provides explanations for all of the Protractor configuration options. Default settings include the standalone Selenium Server, the Chrome browser, and the Jasmine test framework.


Question 5 : What is a spec file in Protractor?  
Spec file is the one where we write actual test code. It contains the logic and locators to interact with an application.


Question 6 : How to exclude a spec file in Protractor?
You can exclude the spec’s by adding them in the exclude tag in your conf.js file.
You can also add patterns to exclude many test scripts with similar names.
Sometimes we may face a situation of running only few tests out of all. In this case, we use exclude tag in our conf.js file to run only few tests. Say we want to exclude test name “myTest.js”
exclude: [myTest.js]

Question 7 : What are the locators in Protractor?
It has unique set of locators particularly to identify elements based on AngularJS attributes.

by.className
by.css
by.id
by.linkText
by.name
by.partialLinkText
by.tagName
by.xpath

Question 9 : How to add custom locator for Protractor?
By using addLocator method.

Question 10 : How do you check the status of a webdriver manager and how do you update webdriver manager?
To check the status of webdriver manager, run the following in your command prompt

webdriver-manager status

To update webdriver manager, run the following code in your command prompt

webdriver-manager update

Question 11 : What is browser’s command in Protractor?
driver.navigate().refresh();

browser.refresh makes a full reload of the current page and loads mock modules before Angular.

Question 12 : What is the difference between “GET” and “NAVIGATE in Protractor?
GET:
Get method is used to navigate to the given destination.
browser.get(“https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.c...
        Navigate:
Navigate method is used to navigate to the given destination
browser.navigate()
If we want to load a previous page or next page in a browser we can use back and forward.


browser.navigate().back();
browser.navigate().forward();

Question 13 : How to accept/cancel Alert in Protractor?
By using accept() method of Alerts class, we accept Alerts in Protractor.

Note: We have to switch the control to the alert using switchTo().alert() before accepting the alert.

browser.switchTo().alert().accept()

browser.switchTo().alert().dismiss()

Question 14 : How do you stop Page Loading in Protractor when an element is loaded?
By using Key.ESC to body element in Protractor.

browser.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESC).perform();
browser.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESC).perform();


Question 15 : What are the browsers supported by Protractor?
Chrome, firefox, opera, IE,Safari

Define the ng-content Directive?

Digest Cycle in Angular & watch in angular
Please explain the digest cycle in Angular?
Answer: The process of monitoring the watchlist in order to track changes in the value of the watch variable is termed the digest cycle in Angular. The previous and present versions of the scope model values are compared in each digest cycle.
Although the digest cycle process gets triggered implicitly, it is possible to start it manually by using the $apply() function.

What is new in Angular 6?
Answer: Here are some of the new aspects introduced in Angular 6:

Angular Elements – It allows converting Angular components into web components and embeds the same in some non-Angular application
Tree Shakeable Provider – Angular 6 introduces a new way of registering a provider directly inside the @Injectable() decorator. It is achieved by using the providedIn attribute
RxJS 6 – Angular 6 makes use of RxJS 6 internally
i18n (internationalization) – Without having to build the application once per locale, any Angular application can have “runtime i18n”


What change detection strategies do you know?
Requirement: Expert Angular knowledge

Answer: There are two strategies – Default and OnPush. If all components use the default strategy, Zone checks the entire tree regardless of where the change occurred. To inform Angular that we will comply with the performance improvement conditions, we need to use the onpush change detection strategy. This will tell Angular that our component depends only on the input and any object that is passed to it should be considered immutable. This is all built on the Principle of the mile automaton, where the current state depends only on the input values.


What is Change Detection, how does Change Detection Mechanism work?
Requirement: Expert Angular knowledge

Answer: Change Detection is the process of synchronizing a model with a view. In Angular, the flow of information is unidirectional, even when using the ng Model to implement two-way binding, which is syntactic sugar on top of a unidirectional flow.

Change Detection Mechanism-moves only forward and never looks back, starting from the root (root) component to the last. This is the meaning of one-way data flow. The architecture of an Angular application is very simple — the tree of components. Each component points to a child, but the child does not point to a parent. One-way flow eliminates the need for a $digest loop.


 How do you update the view if your data model is updated outside the ‘Zone’?

What is runGuardsAndResolvers in Angular 8?
Angular 8 introduced a number of new and unique options to runGuardsAndResolvers. In general, runGuardsAndResolvers is an option which is used for the Angular router configuration in order to control the resolvers and guards. The first option available in runGuardsAndResolvers is pathParamsChange. Through, this option router will re-run the guards and resolvers. Whenever you want to control over the resolvers and guards, use runGuardsAndResolvers option in Angular 8.
